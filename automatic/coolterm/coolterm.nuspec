    <summary>CoolTerm is a simple and reliable terminal application for communicating with other devices over serial ports.</summary>
    <description>CoolTerm is a simple serial port terminal application (no terminal emulation) that is geared towards
      hobbyists and professionals with a need to exchange data with hardware connected to serial ports such as servo
      controllers, robotic kits, GPS receivers, micro-controllers, etc. Despite being a simple application for a
      straight-forward purpose, it offers a wide feature set, some of which are: allowing multiple concurrent
      connections over multiple serial ports, output display in plain text or hexadecimal, Special character (escape
      codes, etc.) handling, sending data via copy-paste or drag-and-drop of text into dialog window, packet capturing
      and recording, echoing sent data locally and/or received data remotely, hardware (CTS, DTR) and software (XON)
      flow control, configurable character/line/packet delays, scripting and saving connection settings as profiles.</description>
